# XposedDex One UI 2.1
Samsung Dex modifications through Xposed

1. Immersive Apps,
Will enable the possibility to define which apps to run in Immersive mode so they remove the titlebar when maximized.

2. Hide Dex Logo,
Removes the Dex logo from the taskbar to have more space (that menu wasn't anyway that useful).

3. Hide NoSIM Icon,
Removes the NoSIM icon from statusbar.

4. Hide App Overflow Buttons,
Removes left and right arrows when to many apps are open.

5. Fix Keyboard,
Enables floating mode for non qwerty keyboard layouts too and fixes dark mode having a white border around the keyboard.

6. Fix Samsung Browser,
Enables secret mode (as it's disabled if Magisk installed) and disable always visible scroll bar (looks ugly under dark mode).

7. Fix Weather,
Keep displaying weather icon in the statusbar.

8. Hide Task Button,
Remove the tasks button on the taskbar.

9. Hide Status Bar Separators,
Makes statusbar more compact and hides empty spaces.

10. Taskbar Fixes
Don't make it fully black (buttons on the taskbar) when window maximized.

NOTE: All changes require a restart.

IMPORTANT: Requires Magisk and edXposed installed on your tablet. 
Only tested with One UI 2.1, Android 10, Build T865XXU2BTC7 so latest release for Tab S6
